ðŸ§  How It Works

1. Upload PDFs from the sidebar

2. Behind the scenes:
   - Text is extracted using PyPDF2
   - Content is chunked into smaller pieces
   - Chunks are converted into embeddings using GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings
   - Embeddings are stored in a FAISS vector database
   - A ConversationalRetrievalChain is created with ChatGoogleGenerativeAI for interactive Q&A
